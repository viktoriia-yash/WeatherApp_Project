I did this project during the "SheCodes Plus" course. To create it, I used:<br/>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript</li>
<li>API from OpenWeatherMap.org</li>
<li>Netlify for hosting</li>
</ul>
The final working result you can find here: <a href="https://marvelous-crumble-fa8f20.netlify.app/">Netlify</a> <br/>
